    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
    
        <li>2 cups extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    
        <li>2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
    
        <li>1 medium onion, thinly sliced</li>
    
        <li>2 teaspoons pink Himalayan salt, divided</li>
    
        <li>6 large eggs</li>
    
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    
    <ol>
    
        <p><li>Heat oil in a deep stockpot over medium-high heat until almost smoking, 2 to 4 minutes. <br>
            Add potatoes and onion; they should be mostly covered with oil. Season with 1 Â½ teaspoons salt. Cook,<br> 
            stirring occasionally and maintaining a gentle simmer, until potatoes are just fork-tender,<br> 
            8 to 12 minutes; do not overcook.</li></p>

    <p><li>Drain potato-onion mixture in a colander; reserve oil for another use or discard. <br>
        Allow to cool for a few minutes, then taste and season with more salt, if needed.</li></p>

   <p> <li>Meanwhile, crack eggs into a large bowl and season with remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt; <br>
    whisk until well beaten. Add potato-onion mixture and toss to coat.</li></p>

   <p> <li>Heat a 10-inch nonstick skillet over high heat. Add 1 teaspoon olive oil, <br>
    then pour in egg-potato mixture. Level it with a spatula and cook for 1 minute. <br>
    Reduce heat to medium-low and cook for about 5 minutes. Run a rubber spatula around<br> 
    the outer edges to make sure it's not sticking and to help it form its shape.</li></p>

    <p><li>Once it starts to firm up around the edges and in the center (although it will still be a little runny),<br>
         place a large plate over the skillet. Flip the omelet onto the plate, then slide it back into the skillet. <br>
         Use the spatula to help press the edges in and under, to maintain a rounded edge. Cook over high heat for 1 minute,<br> 
         then reduce to low and cook until it feels set in the center and a knife inserted in the center comes out clean,<br> 
         2 to 3 more minutes.</li></p> 
</ol>

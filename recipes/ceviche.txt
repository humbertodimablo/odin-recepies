<p>Ceviche, also known as cebiche, sebiche or seviche, is a citrusy seafood dish popular throughout Latin America. It is traditionally made from raw fish and cured with lime. Though its origin is largely debated, it is broadly agreed that this meal can find its roots in Peru.</p>

<p>This mahi mahi ceviche requires a little bit of knife work, but when you consider the seasonal advantage of not using the stove, and just how tasty this really is, I think it's all worthwhile. You can also use shrimp, scallops, swordfish, and snapper.</p>

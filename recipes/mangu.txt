Ingredients

    3 green plantains

    1 quart water

    ¼ cup olive oil

    1 cup sliced white onion

    1 ½ tablespoons salt

    1 cup sliced Anaheim peppers

Directions

    Place the plantains and water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, and cook 20 minutes, until plantains are tender but slightly firm. Drain, reserving 1 cup of the liquid. Cool plantains, and peel.

    Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat, and saute the onion until tender.

    In a bowl, mash the plantains with the reserved liquid and salt. Transfer to a food processor, mix in the peppers, and puree. Serve the pureed plantain mixture topped with the onions.
